    "Since two fair dice are rolled, X and Y can take values from 1 to 6 with equal probability. Therefore, RX = RY = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The PMF of X and Y is given by: P(X = k) = P(Y = k) = 1/6 for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n",

    "4.\tThe range of Z is the set of all possible values that Z can take. Since Z = X + Y, the range of Z is the set of all possible sums of values of X and Y. If X and Y are both discrete random variables, then Z is also a discrete random variable, and we can find its probability mass function (PMF) as follows:\n",
    "PMF of Z(z) = P(Z = z) = P(X + Y = z)\n",
    "We can compute the PMF of Z by considering all possible combinations of values of X and Y that add up to z:\n",
    "PMF of Z(z) = Σ P(X = x, Y = z - x)\n",

    "5.\tUsing Bayes' theorem, we have:\n",
    "P(X = 4|Z = 8) = P(X = 4, Y = 4|Z = 8) / P(Z = 8)\n",
    "Since Z = X + Y, we can rewrite the numerator as:\n",
    "P(X = 4, Y = 4|Z = 8) = P(X = 4, Y = 4, X + Y = 8)\n",
    "Since X and Y are independent, we have:\n",
    "P(X = 4, Y = 4, X + Y = 8) = P(X = 4) * P(Y = 4) = e^(-λ) * λ^4 / 4! * e^(-λ) * λ^4 / 4!\n",

    "3.\tLet X be the number of correct answers. Since the student knew the answer to 10 questions, X has a binomial distribution with parameters n=20 and p=10/44, where n is the number of trials (number of questions) and p is the probability of success (getting the correct answer).\n",
    "The PMF of X is given by:\n",
    "P(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n",
